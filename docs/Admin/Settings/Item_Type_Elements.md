# Item Type Elements

Item Type Elements enables you to manage the metadata fields associated with each [item type](../../Content/Item_Types.md) available in your site, e.g. Still Image, Oral History, Document.

See the [Item Types page](../../Content/Item_Types.md) for the list of elements already included with each pre-defined item type, more information on how to define types and assign elements to them, and how to add entirely new elements. See the [Element Sets](Element_Sets.md) page for more information on the elements common to all items regardless of their types. 

From this tab on the Settings page, you can edit the descriptions of existing elements, to guide your team in using them more effectively. You can also delete elements that you do not wish to have available for use with any item type. 

Add new item type elements
------------------------
You can create a new Item Type element when [editing](../../Content/Item_Types.md#edit-an-existing-item-type) or [creating](../../Content/Item_Types.md#creating-a-new-item-type) Item Types, through the Item Types tab on the left-hand navigation of the Admin dashboard. 

Edit item type element descriptions
-----------------------------------
From the Item Type Elements tab of the Settings page, you can add information about the content, the use, or the style of these fields. Please note that this tab is only accessible for Super Users.

To manage Item Type Elements, select Settings in the top navigation bar. Once the General Settings page loads, click the Item Type Elements tab.

The Item Type Elements tab should load with blocks for every Item Type Element in your site. Each block shows the label for the element (in the top of the block) followed by a description field which you can edit.

Enter information about the Item Type Element here. This description will accompany any Item Type utilizing the metadata field you have just edited. Don't forget to Save Changes when you have finished.

To view your changes, select Item Types in the left hand navigation and select any Item Type containing the element you have just edited by. You can also see these changes by editing or creating a new item and using the Item Type containing that element (see image below for an example).

Delete item type elements
-----------------------------------

To remove an item type element, click the "X" in the top-right corner of its entry on this page. Warning: This will delete all information contained in this field on all the items that use it. You will need to save the page to ensure the element is deleted. You can restore something instead of deleting it by clicking again in the same area, which will have turned red and show an "Undo" icon (a circular arrow). Or you can simply navigate away from this page without saving your changes.
