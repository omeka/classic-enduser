**Standards-based metadata and web design**

- Every item, file, and collection contains fields for unqualified Dublin Core elements. Dublin Core is an internationally-recognized and widely-adopted schema.

- It's easy to customize an installed theme by [modifying the CSS](../Plugins/CSS_Editor.md), PHP, or HTML.
- Custom themes can be built using Omeka Classic’s flexible development API.

**Interoperable**

- Unqualified Dublin Core data, combined with Omeka Classic-generated feeds and OAI-PMH harvestable data, give Omeka Classic sites the ability to share data among different systems and with other Omeka Classic sites. The [Dublin Core Extended plugin](../Plugins/DublinCoreExtended.md) adds a full complement of all DCMI elements.

**Data sharing**

- Share your Omeka Classic data through a variety of feeds including Atom, DCMES-XML, JSON, and RSS2. With the Dublin Core Extended plugin, RDF output is also available.
- Every Omeka Classic site has a REST API enabled which makes your Omeka Classic data discoverable by outside applications. 

**Data migration**

- Populate an Omeka Classic site by adding items individually or batch adding with data migration and upload tools, such as the [OAI-PMH harvester plugin](../Plugins/OaipmhHarvester.md), [Dropbox plugin](../Plugins/Dropbox.md) for files, and API, CSV, and Zotero importer plugins.

**Internationalization of Omeka Classic code**

- Translations available in dozens of languages and anyone may submit new translations.

**Non-Roman character support**
