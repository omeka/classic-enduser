# Site Planning Tips

Before you start building an Omeka Classic site, it is useful to view sites from our [showcase](https://omeka.org/classic/showcase/){target=_blank} and [site directory](https://omeka.org/classic/directory/){target=_blank}. Then think about the way Omeka manages [items](../Content/Items.md), [collections](../Content/Collections.md), and [files](../Content/Files.md) to help plan the content of your site, and to determine how you want your audiences to access and use that content.

Questions to ask while planning
---------------------------------------------------------------

**What are the goals of the website?**

**Who is the primary audience of this website? Secondary audiences?** 

What do you want these specific audiences to accomplish when they come to the site?

**What sections will this website include?** 

Typical top level navigation and sections for a typical Omeka Classic site include:  

  - [Items](../Content/Items.md): links to a browseable list of items, sortable by type of item and tags.
  - [Collections](../Content/Collections.md): groups of items; the public can browse your collections to discover related items.
  - [Exhibits](../Plugins/ExhibitBuilder.md): series of pages that contain interpretative text and rely on items/sources/objects as their building blocks.
  - About: a [simple page](../Plugins/SimplePages.md) sharing information about the project: description, credits, rights, etc.
  - [Search bar](../GettingStarted/Searching.md#basic-search): a quick tool for searching the site's content, with an option to link to an [advanced search](../GettingStarted/Searching.md#advanced-search) page.

**What will I do with items in this website?**

The item is the building block of your site. Items can be photographs, videos, audio clips, newspaper issues (or titles, or articles, or pages), maps, books (or series, or pages), artifacts, quotes, people, events, locations, and other types of data - whatever you need to build your collection. One item can have many media files attached, or only one file, or no file at all. You can group items into a [collection](../Content/Collections.md); you can create a hierarchy of collections using [Collection Tree](../Plugins/CollectionTree.md).

- Determine the **types** of items/sources/objects you plan to use in this site: Document, Still Image, Moving Image, Audio, the [other pre-defined item types in Omeka](../Content/Item_Types.md#pre-defined-item-types), or something custom to your collection, such as people or places. An item can be anything that needs description through metadata fields, or anything you wish to attach media to.
- Do you want to modify any of the **item types** or the item-type-specific **metadata fields**? See [Managing Item Types](../Content/Item_Types.md) to learn more.
- Describe your objects using some or all of the 20 standard [Dublin Core](../Content/Working_with_Dublin_Core.md) fields, plus additional item-type-specific fields. 
- Do you need additional Dublin Core fields? Install the [Dublin Core Extended](../Plugins/DublinCoreExtended.md) plugin.
- Determine, before you start building your collection of items, what **consistencies** you need in your metadata - this may be true for fields such as date formatting, publisher or creator names, etc. 
	* Do you want to use Library of Congress subject headings as a [controlled vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary){target=_blank}? Install the [Library of Congress Subject Headings](../Plugins/Library_of_Congress_Suggest.md) plugin. 
	* Would you like to establish your own **controlled vocabularies** for specific metadata fields, to make it easier for your team to enter consistent data? Install the [Simple Vocab](../Plugins/SimpleVocab.md) plugin.
- You can add **tags** to individual items and exhibits. Do you want to establish a controlled tagging schema? Before building your collections, devise this schema to help control vocabularies and spelling. [Tags](../Content/Tags.md) can help you pull together different items, for purposes such as arranging them on a **map** or displaying them on a **timeline**, or allowing users to browse items with a specific tag.
- Do you have all your metadata ready in a spreadsheet? Bulk-import all the items you need with the [CSV Import](../Plugins/CSV_Import.md) plugin.

Add the objects and materials you want to share. Once you have items in your Omeka Classic database, then you can build an exhibit with them or display categories of items organized by collections or tags.

- Do you have materials in other databases or repositories? You may be able to **import** them in bulk into your Omeka Classic site. 
	* Can items be exported in a Comma Separated Value format? Try the [CSV Import](../Plugins/CSV_Import.md) plugin.
	* Is there an [OAI-PMH](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/){target=_blank} harvestable set online? Try the [OAI-PMH Harvester](../Plugins/OaipmhHarvester.md) plugin.
	* Do you have hundreds of files, or large media files? Use the [Dropbox](../Plugins/Dropbox.md) plugin to import files from another place online rather than uploading from your computer.
- Are you interested in **collecting materials from your visitors** through a web form, including stories, photos, or videos? Install the [Contribution](../Plugins/Contribution.md) plugin.

**How do you want items to display?**

- Do you want to add **social bookmarking** icons to the bottom of item pages, to make it easier for users to share items with their social networks? Install the [Social Bookmarking](../Plugins/SocialBookmarking.md) plugin.
- Do you want to display items on a **map**? Install the [Geolocation](../Plugins/Geolocation.md) plugin, then add geolocation metadata to each item.
- Do you want users to navigate your items chronologically? Install the [Timeline](../Plugins/Geolocation.md) plugin, in addition to providing sortable date metadata, so that items can be displayed in a scrollable timeline. 
- Do you want to allow users to leave **comments** on items? Install the [Commenting](../Plugins/Commenting.md) plugin.
- Do you have documents that you wish users to **read on-screen** rather than downloading them? Install the [DocsViewer](../Plugins/DocsViewer.md) plugin.

Plan an exhibit 
------------------------------------------------------------

The [Exhibit Builder](../Plugins/ExhibitBuilder.md) plugin is not only for building museum-like exhibits. This function can be used to publish essays or teaching materials that draw upon the items in your archive. Note that the Exhibit Builder plugin comes packaged with the basic installation of Omeka Classic. 

Before you build an exhibit, sketch out a storyboard or outline that spells out the sections, pages, and items for each page.

Each exhibit can have multiple sections, which can contain multiple pages. Each page can contain a selection of items, and can be contextualized with some narrative text or captions.

Learn more in the instructions for using the [Exhibit Builder](../Plugins/ExhibitBuilder.md) plugin.

Digital exhibit publishing is a popular class assignment for students, or a way for users and volunteers to contribute to your institution. Learn more about [creating different users and giving them permissions](../Admin/Users.md) to build things on your Omeka Classic installation.

It's also common to create a digital companion exhibit to a physical exhibit in your space. Digital exhibits can expand upon and complement your displays of artifacts. Do you want to print **QR codes** that will link exhibit visitors to individual items in your Omeka Classic site? Install the [Reports](../Plugins/Reports.md) plugin.

Create webpages
---------------------

You can use the [Simple Pages](../Plugins/SimplePages.md) plugin to create web pages for publishing press releases, to add an About or Credits page, to share copyright or access statements, or to build a general web presence for your organization. Any of those pages can become part of the main navigation for your website. Note that the Simple Pages plugin comes packaged with the basic installation of Omeka Classic. 

A Simple Page does not require items or programming knowledge to build, but users can add HTML markup, PHP code, or embedded multimedia objects.
