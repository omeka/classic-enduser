# Examples

The following page is meant to help people new to Omeka get a sense of how others have used Omeka Classic for projects, and inform you how to read an Omeka Classic website to understand what choices the site builders made.

## Case Study

[Histories of the National Mall](http://mallhistory.org){target=_blank} interprets the National Mall's rich past by offering historical maps, a chronology of past events, short biographies of significant individuals, and episodes in the Mall's history. The site is built on Omeka Classic, designed and written for optimal reading on a smartphone or tablet. 

The team behind *Histories of the National Mall* wrote a comprehensive explanation of the process behind the project, from planning to building to outreach. ["Building *Histories of the National Mall*:  A Guide to Creating a Digital Public History Project"](http://mallhistory.org/Guide/){target=_blank} serves as an extended case study in building an Omeka project.

## How to read an Omeka site

While not every Omeka Classic site makes use of every feature, there are common threads that make it possible to recognize an Omeka site in the wild. 

The easiest of these is the message "Proudly Powered by Omeka" in the footer, which is there by default but may be removed in custom themes. Even if that message is missing, there are clues that a site is built in Omeka Classic which can help you understand the choices the site creators made as the built the site. 

**Look at the address bar** 

Omeka sites will almost always have the same paths for certain pages:

- Browse items is siteurl/items
- Browse collections is siteurl/collections
- Exhibits are siteurl/exhibits
- Advanced search is siteurl/items/search. 

Even if the site creators have changed the label for these pages in their navigation menu, the URLs will generally be the same. Checking the address bar to see what function (item, collection, exhibit, etc.) the site is using will help you get a sense of how the creators have structured the site.

**Know your themes** 

Familiarize yourself with the standard [themes](http://omeka.org/classic/themes/){target=_blank} for Omeka Classic - where the menu is located, how the pages are laid out, and other visual markers of the theme. You will be able to identify frequently-used themes even when colors are changed.

**Skim the navigation**

- Pay attention to URLs (exhibit, collection, item, item type, tag)
- Identify plugins by menu navigation label.
