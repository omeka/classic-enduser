# Configuring Language

Open the `config.ini` file found in the folder `{omeka-root}/application/config` in a text editor.

Look for the "Localization" section (at the top), and the line in it that reads: 

```
locale.name = "" 
```

Fill in the two- or four-letter code for the language you wish to use (see below). This information is case-sensitive and must match exactly. For example, to change the Omeka Classic interface language to Brazilian Portuguese, the line should appear:

```
locale.name = "pt_BR"
```

Omeka Classic is [translated](../Technical/Translate_Omeka.md) collaboratively using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com){target=_blank}. You can see the progress of available languages by visiting the [Omeka project dashboard on Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/omeka/omeka/){target=_blank}; the list displays with the most complete languages at the top. Where a language string has not been translated, it will default back to English in the interface.

## Available languages and codes 
Below are the languages in which Omeka is available (for at least 5% of the interface), along with the two- or four-letter codes that you will need to configure Omeka to use your chosen language.
