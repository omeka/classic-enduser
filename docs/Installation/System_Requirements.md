Omeka Classic has the following system requirements:

-   Linux operating system
-   [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) HTTP server (with `mod_rewrite` enabled)
-   [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) version 5.0 or greater
-   [PHP](http://www.php.net/) scripting language version 5.3.2 or greater (with mysqli and exif extensions installed)
-   [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) image manipulation software (for resizing images)

## If your server does not meet these requirements
-   Try [Omeka.net](http://omeka.net) hosting
-   Try third-party hosting services, here are some [suggestions](../GettingStarted/Hosting_Suggestions.md).
