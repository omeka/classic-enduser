# Items

Items are the building blocks of Omeka Classic. To build your digital collections website, you must first add items.

Watch our [screencast](https://vimeo.com/102040466){target=_blank} for a quick introduction to managing and adding items to Omeka:

Before adding items 
---------------------------------------------------------------

You may want to consult the [Site Planning Tips](../GettingStarted/Site_Planning_Tips.md) page to think about how to build your site and what you want to do with your items.

You may also want to decide what type of information you plan to share using the [Dublin Core Metadata](http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/){target=_blank} fields before adding and describing items. You may also want to read about [Working with Dublin Core](Working_with_Dublin_Core.md) for a brief explanation of metadata for Omeka items.

You may wish to work out your metadata fields as you plan batch imports using one of our plugins: [CSV Import](../Plugins/CSV_Import.md), [Dropbox](../Plugins/Dropbox.md), [Zotero](../Plugins/ZoteroImport.md), [OAI-PMH Harvester](../Plugins/OaipmhHarvester.md), or [import from another Omeka installation](../Plugins/Omeka_API_Import.md). 

Add an item 
-------------------------------------------------------------

![Screenshot of the Add Item screen](../doc_files/itemAdd.png "Add Item")

From your items page in the administrative interface (`https://youromekadomain.org/your-installation/admin/items`), click the "Add an Item" button.

This takes you to the `admin/items/add` page, where you see a navigation bar across the top pointing you to four different stages of adding an item. 

1.  The first tab shows the **Dublin Core** metadata fields. These are available for every item in your installation. 
    - Each field can have multiple values; simply click the "Add Input" button beside each field title to add a new input for that field.
    - You can use HTML in these elements if you want; see below for more information. You cannot enter emojis or similar special characters, in either plain-text metadata or the HTML editor.
1.  The **Item Type Metadata** tab lets you choose a specific [Item Type](Item_Types.md) for the object you are adding. 
    - Once you choose the type by using the drop-down menu, relevant metadata fields appear for you to complete. 
    - See [Item Types](Item_Types.md) for information about adding/editing item types.
1.  The **Files** tab lets you upload files to an item.
    - Clicking the "Add Another File" link will reveal another field for adding a file. You can associate any number of files to an item. You can read more about [Files](Files.md) on the next page of the user manual.
1.  The **Tags** tab allows you add keyword tags to your item.
    - Remember to press the “Add Tags” button, after entering your text, to add the tags to an item.

Three more steps to consider:

1.   Make your new item “Public” with the checkbox to the right of the item form, just under the button for "Add Item". If you do not make an item public, it will remain unseen by logged-out visitors to your site, but visible to every logged-in user no matter their [role](../Admin/Users.md#user-levels-and-access). 
1.   Make your new item "Featured" with the checkbox to the right, if you wish it to appear in spots on the public site including "Featured Items" on the homepage. See the [homepage configuration section](../Admin/Appearance/Themes.md#homepage-configuration-options) for more information.
1.   Assign items to a [collection](Collections.md). On the right side of the page, under the "Add Item" button, is a drop-down menu where you can assign your item to a collection. You cannot create a new collection from this menu. Remember, items can only belong to one collection.
  
To finish, click the "Add Item" button to save your data. You cannot save a draft of an item, but you can make it private if you want to edit it further before sharing it publicly.

###  Using HTML in item elements 

Each metadata field's text may be enhanced using basic HTML tags. Check the HTML box below the text box to enable a visual HTML editor. 

![Item element with Use HTML box ticked](../doc_files/itemHTML.png "Item element with Use HTML box ticked")

For more information, see [Using the HTML Editor](Using_HTML_Editor-TinyMCE.md).

Properties of items
-------------------------------------------------------------
**Items**: Each item contains Dublin Core and Item Type metadata, plus other metadata fields added by plugins. An item can have one item type (or none), belong to one collection (or none), and have an infinite number of tags. Items can be public or private, and can be featured. Items may have many or no files attached. You can use [Item Relations](../Plugins/ItemRelations.md) to establish connections between items using metadata fields, or [Commenting](../Plugins/Commenting.md] to allow site visitors to leave their thoughts on items. Items can have location data added using the [Geolocation](../Plugins/Geolocation.md) plugin.

**Metadata**: Each item, each collection, and each file, can have as much or as little metadata as you wish. Metadata can be supplied in Dublin Core or custom formats, using controlled vocabularies, or supplied by users when they create items through the [Contribution](../Plugins/Contribution.md) plugin. Individual fields can be made private through the [Hide Elements plugin](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/HideElements/){target=_blank}, and strings such as email addresses can be hidden within fields using the [Redact Elements](../Plugins/RedactElements.md) plugin.

**Collections**: Items may only belong to one collection at a time. You can use [Collection Tree](../Plugins/CollectionTree.md) to create a hierarchy of collections, so that an item will display in association with a lower-level collection and also its parent collection.

**Tags**: Tags can be added to any item, and an item may contain an infinite number of tags. You can browse and edit tags on the admin side, and add a public page for tag browsing to your navigation.

Browse items in admin
-------------------------------------------------------------
Clicking on the "Items" tab in the administrative interface takes you to a list of items. By default, these are sorted with the most-recently added items at the top.

![A screenshot of the Browse items view](../doc_files/itemBrowse.png "A screenshot of the Browse items view")

The "Browse Items" view displays items in a table. Each row is one item. There are columns for a checkbox (to select items for bulk actions), the item title, item creator, item type, and the date added. 

Click the up-down arrows next to the "Title", "Creator", and "Date Added" headers to sort the items by that field. 

Note that items that are not public will display "(Private)" next to the title. Items that are featured have a small star icon after the item’s title. The image below shows first a featured item (note the star), then a private item, then a general public item.

![A closer look at the table on the Browse Items page](../doc_files/itemsBrowsePF.png "A closer look at the table on the Browse Items page")

Each item has links for "Details", "Edit", or "Delete" just below its title. 

On this page, items are displayed with limited metadata, including the Title, Creator, Item Type, and Date Created. To see additional metadata associated with that item, use the "Details" link under the item's title. 

You may also use the blue "Show Details" button above the table, which will display more information for every item on the page. This will show the first few lines of each item’s description, its collection, and any associated tags.

![Browse items with details shown](../doc_files/itemBrowseDet.png "Browse items with details shown")

To search all items, click the "Search Items" button at the top of the table, which takes you to an [advanced item search page](../GettingStarted/Searching.md).

Edit an item
--------------------------------------------------------------
You can edit any of the information you entered when creating an item, or add new information, from the "Items" page in the left-hand navigation. 

Find the item you want to edit in the list and click the "Edit" button below its title. 

![A teal arrow points to the Edit link for an item](../doc_files/itemEditlink.png "A teal arrow points to the Edit link for an item")

This takes you to the item-editing page where you may make your changes, the same screen you see when you add a new item. You can add new text, tags, files, and location data, or change the existing information.

![The item add/edit window](../doc_files/itemEdit.png "The item add/edit window")

Make sure you click the "Save Changes" button when you are happy with your edits.

Delete an item
----------------------------------------------------------------

You may delete any item from the `admin/items` page by clicking the "Delete" link found below the title. You will be asked to confirm this action.

You may also delete an item by editing the item, then clicking the "Delete" button, found to the right of the page under the link to "View Public Page".

Batch edit & delete
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Click the "Items" tab from the Dashboard or admin screen (`admin/items`). Find items that you wish to edit or delete in a batch by browsing, sorting, or searching. For example, you may wish to look at all items with an empty Title field, by using the "Search Items" button (select "Title" under "Field" and "is empty" under "Type").

Use the checkboxes to the left of the items' titles to select them for batch editing, or select the box at the top left of the table to select all items available on that page. You can also click the "Select all X results" button above the table to edit every item in the current results set.

If you wish to batch-delete items, click the "Delete" button at the top right of the table. You will be taken to a confirmation screen that lists all the selected items by title, where you can un-select individual items if desired. 

If you wish to batch-edit items, click the the "Edit" button at the top right of the table. You will be taken to a batch-editing page where you may make changes.

![The Batch Edit window](../doc_files/BatchEdit.png "The Batch Edit window")

You may change the following fields for each batch of selected items:
-   public or private
-   featured or not featured
-   Item Type
-   Collection
-   add (but not delete) Tags for all selected items. 

You can also batch-delete items. 

Click "Save Changes" to edit all of the selected items.
