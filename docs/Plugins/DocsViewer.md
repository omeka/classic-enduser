The Docs Viewer plugin embeds a Google document viewer into item show pages that [supports a variety of file types](http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1189935).
Note that some files may take a long time to load, and some may not load at all, depending on file size, connection speed, and other variables.

When you use this service you are acknowledging that you have read and agreed to the [Google Docs Viewer Terms of Service](http://docs.google.com/viewer/TOS?hl=en).
