## Contributing to the User Manual

For typos, deadlinks, missing images, and other minor matters, please file an issue against this repository. 

Additions and significant changes should be created in a branch and submitted as a pull request. Please take the following into consideration when writing documentation:

- This is documentation for ordinary users, not developers. Please use clear, jargon-free language. 
- Explain every possible step, even the ones which seem obvious. It is better for users to skip a step they've already completed than be confused by a leap they can't follow. Do not assume any prior knowledge of technology on the part of the user for this documentation.
- Break longer tasks up into short paragraphs or lists.
- Use illustrative images when needed, especially to indicate which button or link users should engage with.

### Formatting 
**Section headings** should start with H2 (`##`) and go down to H4. 
**Links** should be composed as relative to the current file. 
**Images** for a file go into the `doc_files` directory; images for plugin-related pages go into the directory `doc_files/plugin_images`. Begin filenames with the page to which the file is attached, for example `textanalysis_freq.png` is an image for the TextAnalysis plugin.
